# Setting up MySQL

## Creating a database for Pterodactyl
MySQL is a core component of Pterodactyl Panel but it can be confusing to setup and use if you've never done so before.
This is a very basic tutorial that skims just enough of the surface to set MySQL up and running with the panel.
If you're interested in learning more, there are some great tutorials available on the Internet.

### Logging In
The first step in this process is to login to the MySQL command line where we will be executing some statements to get
things setup. To do so, simply run the command below and provide the Root MySQL account's password that you setup when
installing MySQL. If you do not remember doing this, chances are you can just hit enter as no password is set.

``` bash
mysql -u root -p
```

### Creating a User
For security sake, and due to changes in MySQL 5.7, you'll need to create a new user for the panel. To do so, we want
to first tell MySQL to use the mysql database, which stores such information.

Next, we will create a user called `pterodactyl` and allow logins from localhost which prevents any external connections
to our database. You can also use `%` as a wildcard or enter a numeric IP. We will also set the account password
to `somePassword`.

``` sql
USE mysql;

# Remember to change 'somePassword' below to be a unique password specific to this account.
CREATE USER 'pterodactyl'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'somePassword';
```

### Create a Database
Next, we need to create a database for the panel. In this tutorial we will be naming the database `panel`, but you can
substitute that for whatever name you wish.

``` sql
CREATE DATABASE panel;
```

### Assigning Permissions
Finally, we need to tell MySQL that our pterodactyl user should have access to the panel database. To do this, simply
run the command below. If you plan on also using this MySQL instance as a database host on the Panel you'll want to
include the `WITH GRANT OPTION` (which we are doing here). If you won't be using this user as part of the host setup
you can remove that.

``` sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON panel.* TO 'pterodactyl'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## Creating a database user for game servers
:::tip Why this section exists
Much of this is the same as the previous section but minor changes such as granting permissions on the `*.*` set of tables.

The following is to add a database managed by the panel for its game servers
:::

In this guide we assume you have successfully installed the panel using the specified MariaDB (MySQL) as your database and it is on the `0.7.15` version.

### Logging In

``` bash
mysql -u root -p
```

### Creating a User

:::warning When creating your user
To then create a user run. Change `data` and `password` to keep your database safe! (do not use the pterodactyl panel user)

If your database is on a different host than the one where your panel/daemon is installed make sure to use your external IP of the panel host instead of `127.0.0.1` below.
:::

Create the user and set their password.

```sql
USE mysql;
CREATE USER 'data'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

### Assigning Permissions

Give the user access on the database and allow them to grant priviledges as well.

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'data'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

:::tip Datbase configuration changes
Note. You might want to open your database to the internet. This is done by setting its bind-address to `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1` in the my.cnf file.
:::

### Adding the new database to the Panel
Go to `yourpaneldomain/admin/databases` and click `Create New`. This will open up a window in which you can add a database.
Fill the form, following this example:
- Name - A familiar name to reference the database at a later stage.
- Host - The server this database is hosted on. (best if you use the external ip address)
- Port - Port of the database server.
- Username - Username of the user we created earlier.
- Password - Password of the user we created earlier.
- Linked node - Node the database is hosted on. (Default value can be retained)
::: tip
When your database server is on the same node as the game server use `172.18.0.1` and not `127.0.0.1`<br>
Keep in mind the databse you installed with Pterodactyl is MariaDB and not a standard database server, this may cause issues with plugins.

Hit create and you are done!
