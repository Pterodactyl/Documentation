## Backups

Pterodactyl Panel allows users to create backups of their servers. In order to create backups, backup storage has to be configured.

::: tip Backup Limit
You can limit how many backups an user can make of a specific server. To change this, go to your Panel administrative view, select Servers from the sidebar and click the server you want to change the limit of, under the Build Configuration tab on the Application Feature Limits section you will find the Backup Limit option. 
Setting this to 0 will prevent users for creating backups of that server.
:::

### Local Backups
By default, backups are locally saved as a `.tar.gz` file. 

### Using S3 Backups

AWS S3 (or compatible storage) can be used to store backups. The following configuration options have to be set in the `.env` file in order to enable it.

```bash
# Sets your panel to use s3 for backups
APP_BACKUP_DRIVER=s3

# Info to actually use s3
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_BACKUPS_BUCKET=
AWS_ENDPOINT=
```

## reCAPTCHA

The Panel uses invisible reCAPTCHA to secure the login page from brute-force attacks. If the login attempt is considered suspicious, users may be required to perform a reCAPTCHA challenge.

### Configuring reCAPTCHA

While we provide a global Site Key and Secret Key by default, we highly recommend changing it for your own setup.

You can generate your own keys in the [reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).

The keys can then be applied using the Settings in the admin panel. The reCAPTCHA settings can be found on the **Advanced** 

### Disabling reCAPTCHA

:::warning SECURITY WARNING
We do not recommend disabling reCAPTCHA. It is a security mechanism that makes it harder to perform brute-force attacks on user accounts.
:::

If users have trouble logging in, or your Panel isn't exposed to the internet, in can make sense to disable reCAPTCHA.

reCAPTCHA can easily be disabled using the admin panel. In the Settings, select the **Advanced** tab and set the **Status** of reCAPTCHA to **disabled**.

#### Editing your database

If you cannot access your panel, you can modify the database directly using the following commands.


```sql
mysql -u root -p
UPDATE panel.settings SET value = 'false' WHERE `key` = 'settings::recaptcha:enabled';
```
