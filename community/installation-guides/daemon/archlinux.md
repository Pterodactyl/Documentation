# Archlinux
In this guide we will install Pterodactyl's Daemon (wings) — including all of it's dependencies — and configure it
to use a SSL connection.

::: tip
This guide is based off the [official installation documentation](/daemon/installing.md) but is tailored specifically for Archlinux.

## Install Requirements
We will first begin by installing [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) to handle the installation of the Daemon ([from the Archlinux User Repos](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pterodactyl-daemon/) and it's dependencies.

### General Requirements
```bash
sudo pacman -S git base-devel
```

### Yay

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git
cd yay-git
makepkg -scif
```

## Installing the Daemon
```
yay -S pterodactyl-daemon
```

### Docker
(Docker was installed as a dependency when the Daemon was installed)
```
systemctl enable docker
systemctl start docker
```

## Configure Daemon
Once you have installed the daemon and required components, the next step is to create a node on your installed Panel.
Once you have done that there will be a tab called Configuration when you view the node.

Simply copy and paste the code block and paste it into a file called  and save it.
A script has been provided by the installed Daemon package at `/usr/bin/pterodactyl-daemon-config` which opens `/srv/daemon/config/core.json` with nano as root to allow editing.
You may also use the Auto-Deployment feature rather than manually creating the files.

## Starting the Daemon
To start your daemon simply move into the daemon directory and run the command below which will start the daemon in
foreground mode. Once you are done, use `CTRL+C` to terminate the process. Depending on your server's internet connection
pulling and starting the Daemon for the first time may take a few minutes.

``` bash
sudo npm start
```
A script has been provided by the installed Daemon package at `/usr/bin/pterodactyl-daemon` which starts the Daemon with the above two commands.

### Daemonizing (using systemd)

Running Pterodactyl Daemon in the background is a simple task, just make sure that it runs without errors before doing
this. A file called `wings.service` has been included in `/etc/systemd/system` directory when the Daemon package was installed.

Run the command below to reload systemd and start the daemon.

``` bash
systemctl enable --now wings
```
