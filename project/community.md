# Community Standards
Pterodactyl prides itself on providing a warm and welcoming community for all of our members. However, due to the
sheer size of our community, we have a few rules that we expect all individuals to follow at all times.

## Statement of Support
This software is provided to the game community to provide people with the ability to run their servers from a secure
and modern platform. Pterodactyl is provided free of charge, please refrain from treating us as your personal system
administrators or being abusive when we do not reply immediately or hold your hand through every step of the process.
Anyone found to be abusing our support will be removed from this community at the discretion of the Project Team.

You are expected to understand how to read the documentation to use this Panel. We have spent many hours detailing how to
install or upgrade our software; take some time and read rather than copy and pasting and then complaining when things
do not work. This panel does not exist as a drag-and-drop service to run your servers. It is a highly complex system
requiring multiple dependencies and administrators willing to spend some time learning how to use it. If you expect
to be able to install this with no understanding of basic Linux system administration you should stop and turn
around now.

## Community Rules
### Be Mature
You are expected to be mature and control your behavior in a manner that adheres to basic human decency. If you are
unable to do this you will be removed from the community. Personal attacks, spam (in any form), "doxxing", or otherwise
acting out is not allowed.
   
### No Commercial Services
Discussion of paid installation/upgrade services, modifications, or any other commercial offerings is strictly
prohibited. This includes paid modifications or designed for Pterodactyl.

### Respect the Support Channels
Our support channels — those living under the #support name — exist solely to provide _direct_ Pterodactyl related
support. They are not to be used for general Linux questions or other purposes. Please keep these channels clear for
support requests, and be considerate of others by utilizing the emptiest channel at the time. 

### No Direct Messaging for Support
Direct messaging Project Team members or Moderators is forbidden unless you have previously asked for permission.
This rule does not apply if you are in need of urgent attention — for example, reporting security vulnerabilities,
other members breaking rules, or other urgent, _non-support_ matters.

### No Drama
Discussion, including linking to or discussing sites or software, that exists to cast a negative image of other
companies or users is not allowed. This includes calling out hosts using nulled software, attempting to elicit negative
reactions towards other sites, or otherwise stirring up drama.

### No Advertising
Advertising hosting companies in your username is not allowed.
